  ### Project Overview 

  The analysis shows the distribution of overall scores across countries, with a histogram illustrating how scores are spread out. The scores range from approximately 14.45 to 66.85, with a median around 35.25. This indicates a fairly wide variation in the scores.

Additionally, the bar chart displays the average scores by region, revealing which regions tend to perform better or worse on average. For example, some regions may have higher mean scores, indicating better overall performance or conditions, while others have lower averages.

Next, I will provide a brief summary of the key insights from this data.
The distribution of scores suggests a wide variation in country performance, with most countries clustering around the lower to mid-range scores. The regional analysis indicates that certain regions tend to have higher average scores, pointing to regional disparities in whatever metric is being measured. This overview helps identify which areas may need more focus or improvement.

### Data Source

GDB Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "GDB_Data.xlsx" file containing detailed information about the overall score by the country.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Analysis [Download here](https://Microsoft.com)
- PowerBi - Creating reports


### Data Preparation

1. Data Loading and Inspection

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Distribution of scores across regions and subregions.
- identify any notable patterns or outliers.

### Result Findings

The analysis shows the distribution of overall scores across countries, with a histogram illustrating how scores are spread out. The scores range from approximately 14.45 to 66.85, with a median around 35.25. This indicates a fairly wide variation in the scores.

Additionally, the bar chart displays the average scores by region, revealing which regions tend to perform better or worse on average. 

The analysis of mean scores by subregion shows that South America has the highest average score, indicating relatively better performance or conditions in that area. Conversely, Middle Africa has the lowest average score, suggesting more challenges or lower performance levels there.

### Recommendation

Based on the insights, my recommendation;
- As per Liberia, is to focus on regional strategies.
- For Brazil, maintaining or sharing best practices could help other countries in South America improve.

### Limitations

Null
